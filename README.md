HarvardX CS50 and CS50 projects

[CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/)

*Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, **algorithms**, **data structures**, **encapsulation**, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, **Python**, and **SQL** plus HTML, CSS, and **JavaScript**. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.*

[CS50W](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)

*This course picks up where CS50x leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like **Django**, React, and **Bootstrap**. Topics include **database design, scalability**, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, students learn to **write and use APIs, create interactive UIs**, and leverage cloud services like **GitHub and Heroku**.
